# PROJECT SCENARIO
A company has been making code changes by ssh on the server and manually updating the code, this had led to alot issues with untested code being uploaded directly to production which has led to errors and website failures. To fix this issue the comaony has decided to implement a CICD pipeline to automate the deployment of code, so developers do need to manually upload code to the servers.
My Task is to create a CICD pipeline that takes a code from a local computer and automaticaaly deploys them on AWS cloud
With the completion of this project i have been able to demonstrate my capacity to create an enviroment for a faster application deployment for any organization.
